"""macOS permission checks and user guidance.

AIM Flow needs two permissions:
  - Accessibility   : required for global hotkeys (pynput) and auto-paste
                      (osascript System Events keystroke).
  - Microphone      : required for PyAudio to capture audio input.

Microphone access is typically requested automatically by macOS when PyAudio
first opens the audio stream, so we focus on proactively checking and
explaining Accessibility here.
